Today's Episodes -------------------------------------------------------

"A Pataki Palooza"

ACT ONE

Helga - wakes up and ponders "Each morn, I see you bend to drink,
From love's own crystal pool.
I tremble near you, try to think.
Will I forever say, "You stink"?
Am I bound by this tragic rule?"

Merriam - dazed and confused, murmurs "Wha? Where am I? Where am I?"

ACT TWO

Helga - angry and annoyed, shouts "Outta my way you negation to humanity!"

ACT THREE

Helga - while falling asleep, wonders "Arnold my love,
My sultry preteen,
Why must I hold you
only whilst I dream?
Will I be forever enslaved by your spell?
Why must I worship you and never ever tell?
Arnold, you make my girlhood tremble,
My senses all go wacky.
Someday, I'll tell the world, my love...
Or my name's not Helga G. Pataki!"

Merriam - dazed and confused, murmurs "Okay, night night."




"Helga's Stalker"

ACT ONE
